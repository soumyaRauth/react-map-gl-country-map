# Example: Eximtel Map Example GeoJSON

This example showcases how to dynamically add and update custom data sources.

## Usage

The MapGL token is already integrated in this project. In case it isn't working, you need to generate a new [Mapbox token](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens). You can either set it as `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `src/app.js`, or set a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable in the command line. 

There are different data sets availabe in this project. You can find them under the data_source folder. The names for the json files indicates the variants of data.
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
